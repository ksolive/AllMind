    "planner": "In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question."
